# Project Overview
This project was completed for the Algorithms and Data Structures 2 course, developed by three UFU students, aiming to practice graphs, trees, and sorting using the C language.

## üî® Project Features

- `Feature 1` `Play the Maze (graphs):` Players can participate in the game by exploring a maze composed of various areas, represented as graphs.
- `Feature 2` `Game Map Manipulation (binary tree):` The game map is built from text files representing different areas of the maze. Each maze area is represented by a graph, with connections between vertices representing points in the maze.
- `Feature 3` `Player Registration and Management (files):` Players can register their names before starting to play. Player information is stored in a data structure, including the name, total game time, time spent in each area, and score in the central area.
- `Feature 4` `Player Ranking:` A ranking system records player performance based on various metrics, such as total game time and score in the central area. Players can view the ranking, which can be sorted by different criteria, such as total time or score in the central area. Features to add, remove, and reset the ranking are available. InsertionSort is used to sort the ranking.
- `Feature 5` `How to Play Instructions:` The game provides information on how to play, likely explaining the rules, controls, and objectives of the game.
